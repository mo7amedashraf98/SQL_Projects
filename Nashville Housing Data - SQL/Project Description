**Objective:**
This SQL project focuses on cleaning and transforming a dataset related to Nashville housing information. The primary goals include standardizing date formats, populating null values, breaking down address components, updating column values, removing duplicates, and eliminating unused columns.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

**1- Standardizing Date Format:**
Utilized alternative methods to standardize date formats, creating a new column and updating it with converted dates.

**2- Populating Null Property Address:**
Identified and populated null PropertyAddress values by matching records with the same ParcelID.

**3- Breaking out Address Components:**
Split PropertyAddress into Address and City using SUBSTRING and CHARINDEX.
Added new columns (PropertySplitAddress and PropertySplitCity) to store the separated data.

**4- Breaking out Owner Address Components:**
Employed PARSENAME to split OwnerAddress into Address, City, and State.
Added new columns (OwnerSplitAddress, OwnerSplitCity, and OwnerSplitState) to store the separated data.

**5- Updating Column Values:**
Converted 'Y' and 'N' values in SoldAsVacant column to 'Yes' and 'No', respectively.

**6- Removing Duplicates:**
Created a CTE (Common Table Expression) to assign row numbers based on specified criteria.
Selected and removed duplicate records from the dataset.

**7- Removing Unused Columns:**
Dropped unnecessary columns (SaleDate, OwnerAddress, PropertyAddress, TaxDistrict).

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases essential SQL skills for data cleaning and transformation, demonstrating proficiency in handling date formats, addressing null values, restructuring address-related columns, updating values based on conditions, removing duplicates, and optimizing the dataset by eliminating unnecessary columns.
